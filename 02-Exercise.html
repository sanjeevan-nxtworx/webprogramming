        <a href="#News">Punjab Congress leader Amarinder Singh Raja </a>Warring on Saturday shared
        “one of the most horrifying experiences” while travelling in a
        Jaipur-bound Indigo Airlines flight from Chandigarh. According to the
        Punjab Congress Committee (PCC) president, the Indigo aircraft 6E7261
        operating from Chandigarh to Jaipur took off with a faulty air
        conditioning system, leaving the passengers “suffering” throughout the
        journey on Saturday.

        “We were made to wait for about 10-15 minutes in the queue in the
        scorching sun and when we entered the Plane, to our shock, the ACs
        weren’t working and the flight took off without the ACs on!” the
        Congress leader tweeted.
      </li>
      <li>
        He also posted a video which showed passengers using cardboard and
        safety booklets as handheld fans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Warring further alleged that “no one addressed the concern during the
        flight” and passengers were distributed tissue papers to wipe off their
        seats.
      </li>
      <li>
        “Right from the take-off to landing, the ACs were off and all the
        passengers were made to ‘Suffer’ throughout the journey. No one
        addressed the serious concern during the flight. In fact, the air
        hostess ‘generously’ distributed tissue papers to the passengers to wipe
        off their sweat,” he added.
