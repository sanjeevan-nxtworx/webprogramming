              Oahu, in the US state of Hawaii. Its original area of 334 acres
              (135 ha) was increased during the 1930s to 441 acres (178 ha) with
              fill dirt after the US Navy dredged Pearl Harbor to accommodate
              battleships.

            The island was the site of a Hawaiian fertility ritual until
            missionaries stopped the practice by 1830. It was given by
            Kamehameha I to Spanish deserter Francisco de Paula Marín, and was
            later owned by physician Seth Porter Ford. In 1917 the US Army
            bought part of it for use by an aviation division, and by 1939 it
            was taken over by the US Navy.

            It was the site of an ancient Hawaiian fertility ritual, which was
            stopped by <b>Christian missionaries</b> during the 1830s. The
            island was given by Kamehameha I to Spanish deserter Francisco de
            Paula Marín, and later returned to the monarchy. After the island
            was bought at auction by James Isaac Dowsett and sold to Caroline
            Jackson, it became the property of Dr. Seth Porter Ford by marriage
            and was renamed Ford Island. After Ford's death, his son sold the
            island to the John Papa ʻĪʻī estate and it was converted into a
            sugarcane plantation.
