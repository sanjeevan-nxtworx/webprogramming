        This year signaled the start of a new era. Here’s why I believe next
        year is an opportunity to shape the world’s next chapter for the better.

        <p>When you think back on 2023, how will you remember it?</p>
        <div class="flex-para">
        <p>
          For me, this will always be the year I became a grandparent. It will
          be the year I spent a lot of precious time with loved ones—whether on
          the pickleball court or over a rousing game of Settlers of Catan. And
          2023 marked the first time I used artificial intelligence for work and
          other serious reasons, not just to mess around and create parody song
          lyrics for my friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year gave us a glimpse of how AI will shape the future, and as
          2023 comes to a close, I’m thinking more than ever about the world
          today’s young people will inherit. In last year’s letter, I wrote
          about how the prospect of becoming a grandparent made me reflect on
          the world my granddaughter will be born into. Now I’m thinking more
          about the world she will inherit and what it will be like decades from
          now, when her generation is in charge.
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          I can begin to picture it: the tools she will use, the ways she will
          stay in touch with her loved ones, the problems these innovations will
          help solve. We now have a better sense of what types of jobs AI will
          be able to do by itself and which ones it will serve as a copilot for.
          And it’s clearer than ever how AI can be used to improve access to
          education, mental health, and more. It motivates me to make sure this
          technology helps reduce—and doesn’t contribute to—the awful inequities
          we see around the world. I've always been a firm believer in the power
          of innovation to offer every child an equal chance to survive and
          thrive. AI is no exception.

          The early years of a new age are often marked by lots of changes. If
          you are old enough to remember, think back to the beginning of the
          internet. At first, you probably didn’t know many people who were
          using it. But it became more common over time until, one day, you
          realized most people had email addresses, bought things online, and
          used search engines to answer their questions.

          We are just at the beginning of this transition right now. This is an
          exciting and confusing time, and if you haven’t figured out how to
          make the best use of AI yet, you are not alone. I thought I would use
          AI tools for the foundation’s strategy reviews this year, which
          require reading hundreds of pages of briefing materials that an AI
          could accurately summarize for me. But old habits are hard to break,
          and I ended up preparing for them the same way I always do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, AI is far from the only defining feature of 2023. Millions
          continue to experience unbearable grief as a result of Russia’s war on
          Ukraine and in the aftermath of the war in Ethiopia. My heart is
          broken for the continued suffering of Israelis and Palestinians, as
          well as for the people of Sudan. At the same time, more people are
          being forced to endure hardship as a result of more frequent extreme
          weather events caused by climate change. And families around the world
          continue to be hit hard by rising inflation and slow economic growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s no question these are challenging times, but I remain
          optimistic about the future. The speed of innovation has never been
          faster. We’re making big strides on tough problems—like Alzheimer’s,
          obesity, and sickle cell disease—that will improve the lives of
          millions of people. My friend the late Hans Rosling used to say that
          “things can be bad and getting better.” It’s a good reminder that
          progress is not only possible but happening every day.

          That’s why I remain dedicated to making sure that, even in the face of
          setbacks, the world continues to do more to help the poorest people. I
          do the bulk of this work through the Gates Foundation, where my
          colleagues remain dedicated to improving global health, education,
          gender equality, and more. While I could write a thousand pages about
          the incredible work they’re doing with our partners, this letter
          focuses on just a few of the most exciting breakthroughs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also write about why I’m optimistic about the world’s climate
          progress. Most of my climate and energy work is done through
          Breakthrough Energy, although the Gates Foundation is helping people
          in low- and middle-income countries adapt to a warming world. I also
          continue to privately fund research into other areas like Alzheimer’s
          disease. And I still get to advise Microsoft, which gives me insight
          into what’s coming down the pipeline and how it can be used to make
          the world a more equitable place.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m lucky that my work gives me insight into all the ways the world is
          getting better. The challenges we face feel a lot less daunting when
          you understand what exactly it will take to tackle them. In this
          letter, I will share just a few reasons I am optimistic about the year
          ahead. I hope they make you as excited about all the progress to come
          as I am.
